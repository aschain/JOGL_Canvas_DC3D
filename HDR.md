### Deep Color or HDR High Dynamic Range --  Higher bit depths than 8 bits/color if your monitor supports it.

Most monitors are capable of 8 bits of color depth per channel (256 shades of color, 16.7 million colors). That's 24 bits for Red, Green, and Blue, or 32 bits for Red, Green, Blue, Alpha (transparency), all together. Newer monitors are capable of higher bits per color, a common one is 10 bits for RGB (1024 shades of color per channel, 1.07 billion colors, sometimes called 10 bit or 30 bit display), and 2 bits for alpha (for 32 bits). Other monitors can go up to 12 or 16 bits per color channel.
The GLCanvas can display to the monitor in these higher bits. Java represents each color with one byte (256 shades), but GLCanvas can use a short (65536), float (billions), or the more specific 10-bit packed int (1024 shades/color, 4 shades for alpha).
